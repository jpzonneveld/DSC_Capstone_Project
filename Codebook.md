## Codebook
This work has been created in two parts.

* **The milestone report** - Initial exploration and cleaning of the data. First pass at creating a model to predict the next word of a given string.
* **The shiny app** - A functional data product that lets users input a number of words after which the application will predict the next word in the sentence.
   
In order to reproduce this work, go through the following steps.

### Milestone report
The milestone report requires the following input data to be present in the Milestone_Report folder:
* Data_Summary.RDS
* sampleDF.RDS

In order to create the report with the required RDS files execute the following scripts in order:
* 1_Download_Data.R
* 2_Data_Summary.R - Creates the Data_Summary.RDS file
* 3_Data_Cleaning.R
* 4_Data_Exploration.R - Creates the sampleDF.RDS file
* Milestone_Report.Rmd

**Note** that some of the variables may not cary over from one script to the next. Read the comments and scripts before executing them.
